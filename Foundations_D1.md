1. Describe a GitHub repository
    - A directory at the top of the working tree that is used to place data in (e.g. config, README, source code) and each repo will maintain it's own tracking and history
1. Describe a commit
    - A change or set of changes to files in a repo w/ an associated person that made the changes
1. Describe branching
    - A place to safely make changes to the repo without directly affecting others
1. Define a remote in Git terminology
    - A named reference to another Git repo
1. Describe the GitHub flow
    - Lightweight workflow that allows for safe experimentation

## GitHub Entities
